## Description
This application is all about users getting to know their  Akan names which correspond to their date of birth.Akan names are given according to the day of the week one is born.The app therefore identifies the day of birth from the given date.It combines that information with the inputed gender of the user to give the appropriate Aknan name of the user.
## BDD 
#### The app is expected to function as follows:
* Be able to give the user a form for date input.
* Be able to allow the user input their gender ie.either male or female.Other genders do not apply.
* Ensure that the date value entered is a valid date.
* Find the day of the week from the date input and combine that with the gender to output an Akan name that corresponds to that  day of the week.
* A  button that clears the output to allow for the repeat of the process.
